### What I learned

This project gave me additional practice using flexbox. I struggled to get the image to change to the cyan monotone image with eye icon on hover. It took me several tries and several days to get this effect to work. I ended up making a copy of the equilibrium image in Photoshop and adding the color overlay and eye icon into one jpeg file.
